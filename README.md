# Music-fMRI

IN PROGRESS

This repository contains the code used in the Music-fMRI project (cite this).  

raw data can be found (link here) 

I tried to include matlab dependencies, but this version uses the MATLAB parallel toolbox so your system must be set up accordingly. Some file paths need to be modified as well.
